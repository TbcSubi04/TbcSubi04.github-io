         <h2><center>Our Story</center></h2>
         <p>Vintage Couture is a brand that believes in sustainable and ethical fashion. The company understands the value of foundational
            items. Our story started with a straightforward China-Nepal clothing company. However, we become aware of Nepal's lack of 
            uniqueness as a result of the significant changes brought about by COVID. With this, we were unable to restrain ourselves 
            from developing our own look, and as a result, we created our beloved Vintage Couture. High-quality, comfy styles that you may wear 
            every day are a core value of our company. The benefit of choosing our brand is that it is cruelty-free, demonstrating that
            we value both fashion and the serenity of the world equally. Our brand has also been effective in hiring individuals and using 
            human resources from within our nation, which directly benefits the country. every item that  Vintage Couture release tells 
            a tale because we believe in qualitative fashion rather than quantitative fashion. Although we collaborate and our designers bring 
            ideas to the table, it is our devoted customers who make Mode a reality.</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>To earn global recognition as a reputable, authentic, and reliable Nepali brand and be synonymous with quality and 
               affordability. We aimed to promote and uplift Local businesses creating employment opportunities for people and pave the
                way for a new generation to love and support local products.
            </p>
         
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>Our vision is to be one of the most leading & successful Nepali clothing brands providing the best-valued products 
                    and services to global customers. We strive to be a caring and well-managed organization for our customers as well
